# About Me

Hi, I am Fiony. ðŸ‘‹  I am currently an undergrad at the Univerity of Toronto studying Statistics, Mathematics and GIS. Throughout my academic career, I discovered my passion in Data Science and Data Analytics - finding joy in extracting data from datasets and understanding how the data interconnects. 

# Technical Background
I am most familiar with R, Python and SQL. Other languages/frameworks/tools that I have dabbled with include Java and Flask.


#### Here are a few interesting courses I have taken:
- `STA314H1` - Statistical Methods for Machine Learning I
- `CSC207H1` - Software Design
- `STA302H1` - Methods of Data Analysis I
- `STA414H1` - Statistical Methods for Machine Learning II (IPR)
- `CSC343H1` - Introduction to Databases (IPR)
